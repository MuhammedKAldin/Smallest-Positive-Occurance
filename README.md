# Smallest-Positive-Occurance
#Codility 

<b>Write a function:</b>

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example:  
1)given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

2)Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

3)Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
